      <h2>Kitstory is free... forever!</h2>
      <p>
        You heard that right cuties, it's fuckin free; it's the beauty of
        open-source software. But at the cost of being crowdfunded software tho,
        so fuk
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also self-host your own Kitstory instance, in other words, you
        can have your very own character bible, wiki, storyboards, scripts - all
        of that from your own computer.
